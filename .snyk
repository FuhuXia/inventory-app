        After inspecting the Python cryptography package, I see no use of the
        vulnerable method hash() on the classes IPv4Interface and
        IPv6Interface, so the risk here is very minimal. We expect a fix to be
        made available before our 90 day SLA for this moderate severity issue.

        Risk is acceptable during development. We will incorporate a fix before

          Patched to version 3.2; long term fix expected later.
          Version 3.2 of this package contains an incomplete fix,
          which might help reduce the chances of this vulnerability 
          being exploited.
